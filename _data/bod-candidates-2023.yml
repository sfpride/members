    I'm a non-binary person who's been living in SF on and off for almost a decade. I approach conflict first through understanding and believe that holding space for differences—not black or white, but the grey area—is increasingly valuable to us as our co-created culture grows both more networked and our identities more nuanced and, unfortunately, disparate.
    <br><br>
    I've worked in for-profit organizations of different sizes for a decade and have contributed or participated in non-profit organizations (Bay Area Climber's Coalition, Non-Binary Run Club SF, Saint Joseph's Arts Foundation, and Healthcare Foundation Northern Sonoma County).
    <br><br>
    I'd love to participate on the SF Pride Board of Directors to connect with our broader queer community here in SF. I also personally delight in co-creating trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and results with groups of people and would love to participate in this with the Board.
  bio: Adell is a non-binary person in SF. They moved here from Atlanta to be immersed in communities of sociocultural progressives and technological dreamers. They've worked in tech for ten years and continue to believe that sharing access to technology across cohorts is an evergreen pro-social opportunity.

    I feel honored to be nominated to join the San Francisco Pride Board. My life's journey has been marked by adaptability, diversity, and an unwavering commitment to fostering positive change. Hailing from the deep south and moving around the United States as the son of Vietnamese refugees, I quickly learned how to connect with individuals of diverse backgrounds. Graduating from a small, predominantly white college has given me a deep appreciation for the diverse perspectives we have in San Francisco. I've seen the profound impact of committed volunteers in the LGBTQ movement; it all starts with Pride.
    <br><br>
    At age seven, I wrote my first piece of code, igniting a lifelong passion for technology. Yet, music remains the undercurrent of my life, fueling my creativity and humanity. A driving force in pursuing innovative programs and events that amplify LGBTQ voices, I celebrate the vibrancy of our community through technology and song.
    <br><br>
    My activist journey, however, started with a parade. Singing quite loudly in my inaugural Pride parade with the Gay Men's Chorus of San Diego emboldened me to come out as a Gay man to my parents and ultimately catapulted me towards a legal education. A pivotal conversation with mom's church lady friend centered on the debate surrounding Marriage Equality in 2004. I summoned the power of our LGBTQ ancestors that afternoon by winning that debate, inspiring me to pursue a career in law.
    <br><br>
    In 2016, winning the title of Miss Gay Asian Pacific Alliance (GAPA) marked a turning point. Through GAPA, now the GLBTQ+ Asian Pacific Alliance, I deepened my understanding of the unique needs of the LGBTQ Asian and Pacific Islander community. I now champion racial equity and inclusivity within the LGBTQ movement. I'm proud to have co-founded Queer and Transgender Asian and Pacific Islander (QTAPI) Week in 2021, which expanded nationally this year!
    <br><br>
    Having served on multiple nonprofit boards, I bring expertise in board governance, overseeing new initiatives, and urban planning and municipal law. I hope to foster new meaningful collaborations through Pride 365. Community empowerment drives me, and I will build upon the legacy of San Francisco Pride's exceptional endeavors.
    <br><br>
    In conclusion, I am thrilled at the chance to join the San Francisco Pride Board. My commitment to foster positive change, amplify diverse voices, and demonstrate our people belong everywhere is how I interpret San Francisco Pride's Mission. Like Harvey Milk said, ya gotta give ‘em hope!
