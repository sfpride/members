    I'm a non-binary person who's been living in SF on and off for almost a decade. I approach conflict first through understanding and believe that holding space for differences—not black or white, but the grey area—is increasingly valuable to us as our co-created culture grows both more networked and our identities more nuanced and, unfortunately, disparate.
    <br><br>
    I've worked in for-profit organizations of different sizes for a decade and have contributed or participated in non-profit organizations (Bay Area Climber's Coalition, Non-Binary Run Club SF, Saint Joseph's Arts Foundation, and Healthcare Foundation Northern Sonoma County).
    <br><br>
    I'd love to participate on the SF Pride Board of Directors to connect with our broader queer community here in SF. I also personally delight in co-creating trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and results with groups of people and would love to participate in this with the Board.
  bio: Adell is a non-binary person in SF. They moved here from Atlanta to be immersed in communities of sociocultural progressives and technological dreamers. They've worked in tech for ten years and continue to believe that sharing access to technology across cohorts is an evergreen pro-social opportunity.

    I feel honored to be nominated to join the San Francisco Pride Board. My life's journey has been marked by adaptability, diversity, and an unwavering commitment to fostering positive change. Hailing from the deep south and moving around the United States as the son of Vietnamese refugees, I quickly learned how to connect with individuals of diverse backgrounds. Graduating from a small, predominantly white college has given me a deep appreciation for the diverse perspectives we have in San Francisco. I've seen the profound impact of committed volunteers in the LGBTQ movement; it all starts with Pride.
    <br><br>
    At age seven, I wrote my first piece of code, igniting a lifelong passion for technology. Yet, music remains the undercurrent of my life, fueling my creativity and humanity. A driving force in pursuing innovative programs and events that amplify LGBTQ voices, I celebrate the vibrancy of our community through technology and song.
    <br><br>
    My activist journey, however, started with a parade. Singing quite loudly in my inaugural Pride parade with the Gay Men's Chorus of San Diego emboldened me to come out as a Gay man to my parents and ultimately catapulted me towards a legal education. A pivotal conversation with mom's church lady friend centered on the debate surrounding Marriage Equality in 2004. I summoned the power of our LGBTQ ancestors that afternoon by winning that debate, inspiring me to pursue a career in law.
    <br><br>
    In 2016, winning the title of Miss Gay Asian Pacific Alliance (GAPA) marked a turning point. Through GAPA, now the GLBTQ+ Asian Pacific Alliance, I deepened my understanding of the unique needs of the LGBTQ Asian and Pacific Islander community. I now champion racial equity and inclusivity within the LGBTQ movement. I'm proud to have co-founded Queer and Transgender Asian and Pacific Islander (QTAPI) Week in 2021, which expanded nationally this year!
    <br><br>
    Having served on multiple nonprofit boards, I bring expertise in board governance, overseeing new initiatives, and urban planning and municipal law. I hope to foster new meaningful collaborations through Pride 365. Community empowerment drives me, and I will build upon the legacy of San Francisco Pride's exceptional endeavors.
    <br><br>
    In conclusion, I am thrilled at the chance to join the San Francisco Pride Board. My commitment to foster positive change, amplify diverse voices, and demonstrate our people belong everywhere is how I interpret San Francisco Pride's Mission. Like Harvey Milk said, ya gotta give ‘em hope!

   To the Board and Members of San Francisco Pride,
   <br><br>
   It is an honor to be considered for this vital role within an organization that has long been a beacon of hope and celebration for the LGBTQ+ community globally. With deep respect for the history and significance of San Francisco Pride, I am excited to offer my qualifications, experience, and unwavering dedication to the cause.
   <br><br>
   As a physician and a passionate advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, I have devoted both my life and career to advancing the health and well-being of our community. My medical practice, Osra Medical, is a testament to my commitment to providing LGBTQ+ individuals with comprehensive and compassionate healthcare services. Through Osra Medical, I have worked tirelessly to create a safe and inclusive space where all individuals can receive the care they deserve by navigating their lived challenges. 
   <br><br>
   I also have the privilege of supporting the LGBT community now through my nonprofit organization, the Alwan Foundation. This organization, the first in the world to focus on LGBT issues in the Gulf region in the Middle East, stands as an embodiment of my vision for a world where LGBTQ+ individuals can thrive without fear of discrimination or bias.
   <br><br>
   My journey has been inspired by a profound desire to foster understanding, acceptance, and equality for all. I grew up in Qatar and have experienced the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in restrictive environments. I know firsthand the importance of creating platforms for change. My coming-out journey and subsequent groundbreaking activism have been featured in reputable publications such as BBC News, NPR, CNN, TIME, and the San Francisco Chronicle, reflecting my dedication to raising awareness and driving meaningful conversations about LGBTQ+ rights.
   <br><br>
   If granted the privilege to serve on the board of directors, I aim to bring my unique blend of medical expertise, advocacy experience, and global perspective to further strengthen San Francisco Pride's impact. Being part of San Francisco Pride aligns naturally with my absolutely fierce drive to humanize our community despite all of our differences. I am committed to upholding the values of inclusivity, diversity, and resilience that define San Francisco Pride. I am also excited to add more diversity to it with my background from the Middle East.
   <br><br>
   I am deeply honored to be considered for this position and am excited about the prospect of collaborating with fellow board members and the broader community to continue advancing LGBTQ+ rights. 
   <br><br>
   Thank you for your time and consideration.
   <br><br>
   Sincerely,
   <br><br>
   Dr. Nas Mohamed<br>
   Founder, Osra Medical<br>
   Founder, Alwan Foundation
