    I wish to continue building a culture and rigor at San Francisco Pride that can categorically include accountability and transparency. This work that I committed to doing at SF Pride remains to be completed, as I have re-oriented my efforts to keep the organization afloat, alive and above the worldly crises.
    As a community leader who has built many conversations and programs over the past years, I have learnt a great deal of organizing and leadership responsibilities and wish to employ these best practices as I continue to be on the Board of San Francisco Pride.
    I need your vote for SF Pride board to bring further accountability, organization and ensure the most democratic ways of serving the LGBTQ+ community.
    As a South Asian API Immigrant Transgender Brown woman holding a MBA, I have the lived experiences and expertise to bring to robust decision making and results. Those who work with me recognize my bias for action, demonstrated accountability and penchant for collaborations.
    I will further cultivate one of San Francisco's greatest platforms to release its untapped scale and strength to make it better for every LGBTQIA+ person in SF Bay Area and beyond to be in celebration and social justice with one another.
    Over the past 3 years during my first tenure, I have worked with this mindset while leading San Francisco Pride efforts and equally brought about innovative ways of revenue streams when serving as the Board Treasurer.
    I believe there is important work that I can lead at San Francisco Pride board given my expertise in process and project management, community trust in learning of our true needs, a lived experience that informs me to stay authentic and reliable. And above all, as an individual who has delivered results.
    I ask for you vote to continue the current legacy of San Francisco Pride of being majority Transgender seated Board of Directors. Indeed, I know that I have the prime opportunity to truly deliver on the organization’s mission and strategy as we emerge to a “normal” world. I would like to continue serving on the board with your support as San Francisco Pride enters a crucial stage of its journey and required development. I believe in the idea of collective leadership that leads to our liberation, and only strengthens an organization by distributing my commitment to it.
    I appreciate your vote.

    Let me introduce myself, I am Linda Martley-Jordan a African American lesbian who is the mother of 4 grown children, foster mother to one daughter and the grandmother to 7 awesome grand children.
    I am an educator, thought partner, advocate, collaborator and lover of music.
    My life for the last 20+ years has been to allow individuals, especially young people, to self-identify and live life as their best self. I believe that the support of all of the community is important regardless of race, creed, national origin, sexual identity, or gender identity. As a member of the Pride Board I will integrate the work I have had the privilege of doing with our youth and plan to continue supporting LGBTQIA+ youth in San Francisco County by lifting their voices on issues that have affected their lives and that they are concerned about in San Francisco and San Francisco County. I will support policies that provide the necessary protections to the LGBTQIA+ students, and their right to exist without harassment or physical attack.
    Second, I have never, nor will I ever tolerate any discrimination within my control or presence. I believe all the citizens of San Francisco have the right to live free from intolerance and bigotry.
    Vote for me to support moving the needle on issues for our LGBTQIA+ community.
