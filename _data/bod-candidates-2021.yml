    <p>In his time on the Board, Manuel is proudest of two long-term projects. In 2019, he organized “Orgullo y Tesoro,” SF Pride’s first-ever bilingual and bicultural fundraising event, complete with performances and partnerships with Latinx LGBTQIA+ organizations from the San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose areas. Fully sponsored, with all goods and services donated, the event generated $5,067 in profit for SF Pride while incurring no costs. During the last year, Manuel has also served as chair of SF Pride’s Policies & Procedures Committee. With the support of the Board, the committee has successfully conducted a full review of the organization’s policies and procedures, including an in-depth review of the bylaws, which are up for member vote at the 2021 Annual General Members meeting. This review cycle includes updates to some sections of the organization’s governing documents that had not been updated since 2016.</p>
    <p>Manuel has 18 years of experience in higher education in California. He is currently the Vice President of Student Services at Cañada College as part of the San Mateo County Community College District. He is also part-time faculty at the University of San Francisco in the Performing Arts & Social Justice Program and the School of Education, where he received his doctorate in 2017.</p>
    <p>Manuel first joined the SF Pride Board in Spring 2018 with the goal of supporting initiatives that connect more communities to the SF Pride family. He hopes to continue these efforts to build deeper relationships with other organizations in the community and further activate what it means for SF Pride to commit to liberation.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Nguyen Pham is grateful for his time on the San Francisco Pride Board of Directors, and proud of the work that he has contributed these past several years. And he is not finished!</p>
    <p class="card-text">When he accepted his initial nomination to join the Board, he did so to give back to an organization that had lifted and centered him since his youth. Nguyen was a teenager when he first marched in the SF Pride Parade, as a high school student with the GSA (Gay-Straight Alliance) Network; a teenager still, the following year, when he marched as a college student with UC Berkeley’s Queer Resource Center; and even still, a teenager that following year when he began his 20-year (and counting!) tenure as a performer with CHEER San Francisco, the world’s longest-running, queer-centered, charitable cheerleading team.</p>
    <p class="card-text">Today, as Nguyen reflects on this lived experience alongside his years of service as Board Secretary, he seeks to continue the trajectory that began all those years ago: to lift and center marginalized queer lives. He wishes to keep innovating as he did, in 2019, when he helped to produce the inaugural SF Pride Golf Tournament: the first and only PGA-endorsed event that ensures queer visibility in one of the most cis-heteronormative spaces in the world—as well as SF Pride’s most lucrative Board-led annual fundraiser to date.</p>
    <p class="card-text">This journey has been challenging and uncomfortable; and it has been necessary and nourishing. It is with this abundant energy and constructive outlook that Nguyen pledges to honor SF Pride, our stakeholders, and our communities as we navigate through the next wave of uncertainty, COVID or otherwise. With your support, and with your vote, it will be his humble privilege to champion SF Pride’s important work as we continue to educate, commemorate, celebrate, and liberate.</p>
