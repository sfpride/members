title: 2020 AGM and Board of Directors Election
---

The Board is resolving to separate the board elections from the Annual General Meeting
on September 12, 2020. Because we canâ€™t meet in person, due to the ongoing pandemic, and
because the secret ballot process is important to the election, we believe it is best to
conduct the elections by mail, according to the process that the staff has developed.
