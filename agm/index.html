<p>To ensure that members may exercise their full ability to participate in the meeting, we've laid out some guidelines

                <h2>1. Joining the Meeting</h2>
                <p>The AGM room will open at 11:30am, and you may join at any time afterward until the meeting is
                    adjourned some time around 3pm. Proceedings should begin at noon, as we allow for members
                    to check in.</p>

                    <p><strong>If you are joining by phone audio</strong> (a phone call), many of the features described
                        here may not be available to you. We are cognizant of this, and will take steps to enable
                        participation by members calling in.</p>
                    <p>Phoned in participants may be asked to record their votes verbally using a role-call, the
                        facilitator calling on each member individually when appropriate.</p>

                <h2>2. Checking into the meeting</h2>
                <p>If you've attended in-person AGMs in the past, the check-in process should be relatively familiar to
                    you. Once you've joined the meeting, Pride staff will greet you and ask your name to verify your
                    voting eligibility before moving you into a breakout room where the meeting itself will take place.
                    <strong>You will get a popup to confirm your move into the breakout room where the meeting will take
                        place.</strong> While the AGM is open to the public, only SF Pride members in good standing may
                    vote. New members are considered Associate Members for 60 days after they join and may not vote.</p>
                <p>Members with voting rights will have their name modified with a preceding "V - " like this:</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center mb-3 mx-5 border rounded bg-dark text-light">"V - Jane Smith"
                </blockquote>
                <p>As members are checked into the meeting, we will keep track to determine if quorum has been met and
                    if it is lost at any time by members leaving the meeting. This information will be made available to
                    attendees via a special video-only participant, it will look like this:</p>

                <h2>3. Obtaining the Floor</h2>
                <p>If you wish to be recognized by the facilitator to speak, you may do so by selecting the <span
                        class="text-primary">"raise hand"</span> button:</p>

                <p>Periodically the facilitator will ask if anybody calling in by phone would like to be recognized to
                    speak, or to be added to the "stack" of speakers.</p>

        <h2>4. Voting at the Online AGM</h2>
        <p>Actions of the membership at meetings fall, broadly, into two categories: (1) <b>procedural</b> and (2)
            <strong>substantive</strong> motions.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <dl>
                    <dt>procedural motions</dt>
                    <dd>related to the process by which the meeting is conducted, like:</dd>
                    <ul>
                        <li>allotting time to a discussion</li>
                        <li>closing or tabling a motion</li>
                        <li>meeting adjournment</li>
                    </ul>
                    <dd>Many of these type of motions are non-contentious and the facilitator may call only for
                        objections, instead of yes/no votes. This might look like:</dd>
                    <dd class="m-0 p-3 blockquote bg-light rounded p-2">"We have a motion to add five minutes, are there
                        any objections?"</dd>
                    <dd>If the facilitator hears no objections there is no need for a formal vote, and the meeting may
                        proceed having accepted the motion with unanimous consent.</dd>
                    <dd class="text-danger">If you wish to object, you may do so by selecting the <strong>no</strong>
                        button available under the participants menu (see below), or you may unmute yourself to dissent
                        verbally. </dd>
                    <dd>If there are objections, or at the facilitator's discretion, the facilitator will call for
                        participants to record their vote as below: see <a href="#substantive-motions"><em>substantive
                                motions</em></a>.</dd>

                <dl>
                    <dt>substantive motions</dt>
                    <dd>related to the purpose of the meeting, or decisions made about items on the agenda, substantive
                        motions represent actions by the decision making body and should be: </dd>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>concise</b> &ndash; brief but comprehensive </li>
                        <li><b>narrow</b> &ndash; restricted to one idea</li>
                        <li><b>positive</b> &ndash; SF Pride <em>shall do X</em>, instead of <em>shall not</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <dd>Substantive motions, or <em>main motions</em>, are the culmination of the deliberative process,
                        and are representative of the membership. As such, at the conclusion of discussion of an item,
                        when the question has been called, or for motions that may not be debated, the facilitator will
                        call for members to use the tools built into zoom to record their vote.</dd>
                    <dd class=" blockquote my-4 bg-light rounded p-2">"We have before us a motion to... , please record
                        your vote using the yes and no buttons. Those wishing to abstain should not vote, and their
                        abstention will be recorded."</dd>
                    <dd>To access the voting buttons, select <strong>"participants"</strong> from the bottom of the

                    <dd>At the bottom of the participants window that appears on the right, select either the <span
                            class="text-success">yes</span> or <span class="text-danger">no</span> button. You may
                        indicate abstention by not entering a vote.</dd>

                    <dd>Please leave your vote until the facilitator indicates that votes have been tallied and shares
                        the result.</dd>
