        <p>For many years the current members of San Francisco Pride were listed in the <em>Inside Pride</em> printed magazine, as a way to to honor them and show their support for the organization. During and after the COVID-19 pandemic printed materials were deprioritized and this page was created instead.  Members in good standing may request a membership list.</p>
