On behalf of the S.F. Pride board of directors and Pride's membership, We all would like to welcome our new S.F. Pride Members into the fold. We are very excited to have you with us. We look forward to our bright future together. In joining this world renown organization, (The biggest of it's kind in the world) you too, can help us in bringing to our LGBTQIA+ community the respect and Pride we deserve.

In recent years S.F. Pride has started to shift its focus away from just a huge celebration on the last weekend of June, to a Pride 365 approach. And I'd like to share with you some of our upcoming events we hope you too will join us in supporting and participating in.
 
Our annual general meeting is on September 10th @ the LGBT Center in San Francisco. Here you will have a chance to voice your vote for new nominees for the open board seats for the up coming term. In addition, any changes to our bylaws, and a chance to meet in person with others of the membership.

Then on September 17th @ S.F. Eagle Plaza will be our gratitude party for all the volunteers and awards for the pass parade.
 
On September 30th @ El Rio the Annual Latinx Pride party.

Then on October 7th&8th The annual S.F. Pride gold tourney.

A reception on the 7th @ the Fairmont Hotel and the tourney at Harding Park on the 8th. (We can always us volunteer help at all events).

And to cap things off on October 20th @ the Hilton Cityscape our Annual Awards presentation of the Ken Jones Awards.

These events will round out 2022.
 

So happy to have you all on board with the rest of us.

Blessings

Di'ara Melite Reid Board member She/Her
