                    <p>Eligible voters will receive a packet by mail via the <abbr title="United States Postal Service">USPS</abbr>, which contains all the physical materials they need to participate in the <strong>2020 San Francisco LGBT Pride Parade and Celebration Committee Board of Directors Election</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Members shall cast their votes by indicating their choices in the box to the right of the candidate's names on the paper ballot, and may vote for as few or as many candidates of their choosing to fill the possible <strong>seven (7)</strong> open seats on the Board of Directors.</p>
                    <p>Those candidates receiving the highest <strong>simple majority</strong> votes <strong>(50% + 1 of votes cast)</strong> will fill an open seat in the order according the numbers of votes attained. In the event of a tie that would determine the election or non-election of any nominee, a secondary election by will be held for those candidates only.</p>
                    <p>A number of ballots equal to or greater than a quorum of the membership (one third) on the date ballots are printed (August 20th) must be cast for the election to be valid and representative of the membership. <span class="d-print-none font-weight-bold">The exact number of ballots required will be noted on the ballot.</span> <span class="d-none d-print-inline">The minimum number of ballots that must be returned is: <strong>77 ballots</strong></span></p>
