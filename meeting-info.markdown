## Mission Statement

The mission of the San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Pride Celebration Committee is to educate the world, commemorate our heritage, celebrate our culture, and liberate our people.

## Financial Protocol

No expenditure can be incurred without going through the Executive Director in advance. This includes reimbursement of expenses outside of the set guidelines. If you expect to have an expenditure, prior approval must be sought from  the Executive Director as soon as possible. Procedures exist and checks, and balances are in place to ensure that all expenditures go through a proper approval process with the Board. All expenditures are accounted for during the annual budgeting and audit process.

## Public Comment

The public comment portion of the meeting is an opportunity for those with no say in the formulation of the agenda (i.e., those who are not members) to speak during the meeting. Public comment is offered in a spirit of open communication and the organization being receptive to new ideas and constructive suggestions. 
The Chair of the meeting may adopt a flexible approach in allowing public comment but will not tolerate personal attacks and/or indecorous behavior.

## Land Acknowledgement Statement (as of January 28, 2021)

We at San Francisco Pride acknowledge that we are meeting on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush Ohlone peoples, the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula.

## Meeting Behavior Policy

Applying to anyone and everyone who attends meetings of the Corporation, this policy is designed to give guidance to those attending meetings of the Corporation as to what standards of behavior are required and what is unacceptable.
In order to conduct its business in a mature and respectful manner it is essential that those attending meetings of the Corporation adhere to the process and do not engage in disruption of the meeting. 

Behavior should show respect for:

1. The process
2. The Chair
3. Anyone present
4. Any member, director, staff, or volunteer of the Corporation

If a person or group of persons disrupt a meeting and ignores two warnings given them by the Chair at that meeting, they will be removed by the sergeant-at-arms, for the purpose of being given an opportunity to calm down. 
Such person or persons may rejoin the meeting later, 
but if they continue to be disruptive, 
then upon being given a third warning by the Chair, 
they will be removed by the sergeant-at-arms from the meeting; not allowed to rejoin the meeting; 
and have their membership of the Corporation (in the event that they are members) suspended, 
pending a hearing by the Community Affairs Committee; and possible expulsion as a member.

Anyone present at any meeting shall have the power to call for a three second silence to help calm a tense situation.

A Sergeant-at-Arms shall be appointed at every meeting, and in default, shall be the Vice President of the organization.
