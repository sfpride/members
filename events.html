<p>Share an event on this page by attending one of our <a href="/">meetings</a>, usually the first (Board of Directors) and second (Membership) Wednesday evenings of every month. These events may not be explicitly endorsed by San Francisco Pride, or even by the person or entity that has chosen to share it.</p>
