                        <p class="card-text">Hi there, my name is Maxie Bee (she/her/hers). Pride is one of my favorite
                            events in San Francisco, and every year I have lived here I have eagerly partaken in the
                            festivities and chaotic beauty that is the LGBTQ+ community’s largest celebration. Each year
                            I have admired the pride and beauty of every attendee who has taken the time and shown the
                            courage to be unabashedly themselves. I wish I could say that with each year my love for our
                            city and Pride as an event has grown, but I’m saddened to say that I have become
                            increasingly dismayed and forlorn at the state of what should be our greatest event of the
                            year.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">There are few of you who will ever read these words. For each one of you
                            participating in this year’s election, there is an ever-mounting number of LGBTQ+ people
                            each year who decide to give Pride a pass. Their reasons are many, but I hear repeatedly
                            that they feel that Pride isn’t for them anymore. It’s for the vast corporate floats and
                            advertisements that dominate every space.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The Pride Organization’s plummeting membership shows similar trends. Last
                            year a spike of interested and incensed people signed up, hoping to be heard not just about
                            overwhelming corporate involvement, but also about the awful police brutality last year when
                            peaceful protesters were brutally attacked by SFPD. They wanted the parade, often described
                            as a three-hour pink-washing commercial, to return to its roots as a force for political
                            mobilization and solidarity among all LGBTQ+ people. The fight for justice is as far from
                            over as it is intersectional, and their arrival and disappointment should be an
                            extraordinary wake up call to SF Pride.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Many of those who came for change last year were gone this year as they
                            felt ignored and unheard. In the wake of COVID-19, rising fascism, and awful economic times,
                            we must pivot. What is Pride if the event can only occur with assistance from the very
                            corporations that hurt so many queer people every day, despite their flashy rainbow
                            marketing. If we must rely on them then Pride must be rethought and reinvented. Pride must
                            return to its roots as en event by the community and for everyone in the community. Right
                            now, we need solidarity more than ever, and our greatest event should lead the charge.</p>

                            organized around Pride at varying levels for almost a decade. She is an SFSU alumni and is
                            concerned with the extreme corporatism that seems increasingly prevalent at Pride each year.
                            She works as a legal assistant at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and is strongly
                            committed to community-driven, intersectional change that will make Pride more independent
                            from its sponsors and more inclusive of those in the LGBTQ+ community who are most left out.
                            She has a strong commitment to racial, sexual, and economic justice, and hopes that Pride
                            can use its platform to uplift those most marginalized in our society, especially in the
                            wake of the the worsening calamities of Trump and Coronavirus.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Hi! I’m Laurence Berland (he/him). I’ve met many of you at Pride’s monthly
                            board and member meetings over the past 15 months. It has been so great to get to know you.
                            I would like to get to know you all over the coming years.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">I originally became involved in Pride because my then-employer, Google,
                            sponsors Pride and other LGBTQ+ events but does not actually protect us on their services.
                            On YouTube, for example, transphobic and homophobic harassment runs rampant. In 2019, my
                            coworkers and I petitioned Pride to remove Google from the parade. Pride refused but offered
                            us a spot in the Resistance Contingent where I found myself surrounded by other activist,
                            labor, and community groups — the best of the LGBTQ+ community. The crowd? Loved us! But
                            other queer protesters exercising their right to speak out on important issues were beaten
                            and arrested by SFPD. Protest is an essential part of Pride and should be encouraged. We
                            must keep our whole community safe from police.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Later that day, my coworkers and I staged a protest against Google’s
                            corporate contingent. This required us to spend hours watching the parade from Market Street
                            which I had not done in many years. We found a crowd that, more than anything, was bored by
                            the parade of corporate floats, and eager to join us to fight for something important. I’m
                            still concerned about corporate and police presence at Pride and will advocate for real
                            change.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">What I have learned in trying to make these changes is that Pride needs to
                            be more transparent, more accountable, and more engaging, both with its membership and the
                            community. Our members are our greatest asset. They offer their time and energy to Pride. We
                            should welcome them and give them a greater role in setting Pride’s direction. Pride belongs
                            to the entire LGBTQ+ community. We must honor our stewardship by engaging more with all of
                            our community, especially BIPOC and trans folks who are too often left out. Pride must be a
                            welcoming and uplifting place for all of us.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">We all face these changes together, for each other. As Pride faces new
                            challenges like COVID-19, we must rethink Pride together. The board cannot and should not do
                            it alone. The membership and community must be included. I hope I can count on your vote,
                            and your involvement.</p>

                            because I am a servant worker who likes to work in the background to leverage partnerships
                            to grow opportunities. I am a lifelong San Francisco resident who grew up in the Fillmore
                            neighborhood and raised my children in the Bayview neighborhood. I grew up in San Francisco
                            in a time when the influence of our LGBTQ community was growing but I saw my Black queer and
                            trans friends still struggling.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">I credit a large part of my love and advocacy for the LGBTQ community to
                            Mika my trans sister who is currently living with AIDS in SF. I watched her grapple with
                            being bullied at 10-years-old. From coming out and moving to New York to get away from her
                            family who wasn’t accepting of her. I heard the pain in her voice when she first told us she
                            contracted AIDS before her 21st birthday after turning to sex work to sustain herself.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">While a student at Skyline College, I helped to organize one of their
                            biggest and most visible AIDS Awareness programs for the Associated Students of Skyline
                            College (ASSC) “World AIDS Week and International Day on December 1, 2004.” We partnered
                            with our campus health center to focus on prevention through educating students about the
                            disease via guest speakers, movie presentations, condom giveaways, hands-on-activities, and
                            a mobile HIV testing van.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">My everyday work is creating spaces as well as policies that improve the
                            quality of life of Black San Franciscans. I am the founder of the Big Black Brunch which
                            supports Black owned SF restaurants and will soon be coming to Yelp as a black owned
                            listing. I created the Black Ballot Box to encourage community members to make sure they are
                            registered to vote so that we could support issues that benefit the black community. I
                            helped organize the Assembly for Equity 4th of July March. I have done so many events for
                            Black San Franciscans yet became aware that black queer and trans community members didn’t
                            feel supported or safe in those spaces. If there is one Black San Franciscan that doesn’t
                            feel safe within our community then that is something that needs to be addressed.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">If elected I will center the experience, wellness and success of Black

                        <p class="card-text">I’m Tyler (he/him), I’ve attended SF Pride most years since about 2014.
                            I’ve been an official member for about a year. I am a former member of the San Francisco
                            Lesbian/Gay Freedom Band, and I have been active on and off in the Democratic Socialists of
                            America since 2017. I have not served on a board like this before, so if elected I hope the
                            rest of the board will be patient with me and help me learn the ins and outs of working
                            together on this board. There are a few things I hope to achieve in my term:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="card-text">First, make Pride more democratic: Make sure it’s as easy as possible
                                for people to become members of Pride or to participate in discussions. Make sure every
                                board meeting and member meeting is well-publicized on social media. Update the
                                organization’s bylaws to make it easier for people to offer suggestions.</li>
                            <li class="card-text">Have a celebration that is more focused on our community than our
                                corporate sponsors: Many of Pride’s long-time partners are also partners of
                                organizations directly opposed to queer liberation, such as the Republican Party, the US
                                Military, Border Patrol, ICE, and union-busting consultants. I want 2021 to be the year
                                these companies stop using SF Pride to launder their image. To do this, we need to
                                convene the Corporate Accountability Committee immediately. The committee’s
                                recommendations may result in a celebration that is smaller and less extravagant than
                                we’re used to, but the handful of unofficial celebrations that happened this year showed
                                us that such events can be just as fun and meaningful!</li>
                            <li class="card-text">Have a clear and detailed agreement with law enforcement: If we are
                                able to have an in-person event next year, we must make it clear what we expect from law
                                enforcement. In particular, there should be no arrests of anyone unless they pose a
                                danger to others’ safety, and the number of officers present must be kept to a minimum.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="card-text">On a related note, law enforcement should not be a participant in any
                            official Pride events. I used to think policing was reformable, but in the last few years,
                            and particularly after the most recent wave of Black Lives Matter protests, I have come to
                            believe that any celebration in which police officers march proudly is not one which is
                            oriented toward the liberation of our people.</p>

                            Francisco Pride Board. My parents immigrated from Cuba and chose San Francisco as a city to
                            seek refuge. It is a city that celebrates acceptance and diversity, a characteristic that I
                            find it my duty to always continue to fight for, as others seek to call this home.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">I am a Broadcasting graduate of San Francisco State University, and my
                            media background has served a positive purpose in my career and organizations that I
                            advocate for. For over 25 years, I have been a spokesperson on Tourism and its economic
                            impact on our City. Hospitality has a huge impact on San Francisco, as it touches several
                            communities with job opportunities. I have worked for over 20 years in hotel companies that
                            have headquartered themselves here, such as Joie de Vivre Hotels and now my own consulting
                            firm called Hunter Hospitality.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">I most recently served as Chairman of San Francisco Travel (Convention and
                            Visitors Bureau) where I was able to celebrate our expansion of the Convention Center.
                            Currently I reside on the SF Travel Board and strategically work on a recovery plan during
                            these very difficult times. I can assist SF Pride in many ways. I am able to communicate
                            bilingually if you need my assistance with our Spanish-speaking communities. I can also
                            assist with partnerships and strategic alliances when promoting SF Pride to the world.
                            Again, it would be my honor to serve on the Board and look forward with much PRIDE to be
                            able to do so. Thank You!</p>

                            immensely powerful way to make community in the bay. Protests for Black Lives Matter, black
                            and brown bodies left to die in Californian jails (the largest share of the 2 million
                            incarcerated Americans), pandemic fatalities impacting black and brown families
                            disproportionately and the cry for defunding the police is the conversation communities are
                            having everywhere in this country. What is SF PRIDE doing?</p>
                        <p class="card-text"><strong>Money is Politics:</strong> Digging into my organizing experience
                            against white supremacy, I’ll institute a Community Town Hall (virtual and online) that will
                            be a repository of all voices of dissent and advo-cacy for/against any community and/or
                            corporate partner that SF PRIDE board is dealing with/promoting for any event. And holding
                            all our corporate and community partners accountable by setting standards of LGBTQ and POC
                            hire percentages in their organizations as a clear indicator of how expensive their
                            partnership with PRIDE should be. You don’t care about us – we take more money from you.</p>

                            and bigotry using taxpayers’ money. The same s&&t is happening rn. What is SF PRIDE doing?

                            platform to uplift the struggle the community is facing. I am already leading that with an
                            SF tenants’ coalition.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">I am a fundraising professional with more than a decade of experience
                            raising resources and awareness for community needs in the Bay Area. My intention in running
                            for re-election to the San Francisco Pride Board is rooted in supporting the organization's
                            long-term sustainability while raising the profile of this legacy organization. San
                            Francisco Pride has been a leader in our LGBTQ movement, and we have even more of an
                            opportunity to push for change. The way we convene and celebrate will be dramatically
                            different for the foreseeable future. Consequently, the way Pride events are funded will
                            need to be reevaluated. Running for re-election for the Board was a decision I did not take
                            lightly; the challenges facing the organization are complex, require collaborative
                            approaches and community engagement to make change. As a Board member, my focus continues to
                            be on diversifying the organizations’ revenue, leveraging our existing network and growing
                            beyond, to ensure that we can have a Pride event this year and for the next 100.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">My professional experience in fundraising is an asset to SF Pride and
                            particularly during such pivotal times. In addition to my professional role as Associate
                            Director of Philanthropy for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, I also serve on the
                            Advisory Board of the Castro LGBTQ Cultural District, a neighborhood initiative to preserve
                            and promote the rich cultural heritage of our community. Past leadership opportunities that
                            have uniquely prepared me to continue my Board service for Pride include serving as the
                            Co-Chair of the San Francisco Dyke March; Founder of and Advisor to the San Francisco
                            Women’s March; and a member of the Association of Fundraising Professionals, Golden Gate
                            Chapter. Through these experiences, I gained valuable knowledge and familiarity of
                            organizing, community engagement, building effective relationships with City leadership,
                            volunteer management, and mentorship for new and emerging leaders. Overall, I feel that my
                            professional experience and deep community commitment will continue to be of tremendous
                            benefit to SF Pride. I hope to continue supporting SF Pride and appreciate your
                            consideration.</p>

                            HIV+postive, I’ve been a longtime community member and advocate for LGBTQIA2S communities.
                            I’ve participated in social justice and human rights causes since I was in grade school.
                            First, as a farm worker with my family and picketing with the United Farm Workers movement

                            and recently celebrated my 48th birthday, a huge milestone that many Trans women of color do
                            not get to experience because of the hate and violence that perpetrates our Transgender
                            communities. As a member of the board, I hope to continue to help shape and develop ideas
                            and discussions that promote strong inclusive/diverse principles not only for the
                            Transgender community but all communities that need a strong voice at the table.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">As a native San Franciscan and former Pride Board Member, I have dedicated
                            my life to public service. Most of my professional career has been with our beloved the City
                            and County of San Francisco. Eight years of that time I was appointed by Mayor Willie Brown
                            to lead as the Director of the Mayor’s Office on Homelessness, where I coordinated with all
                            City Departments on policy, budgeting and contracts. I also collaborated with other city
                            governments to obtain federal funding for housing and other vital services to assist at-risk
                            San Franciscans to achieve self-sufficiently.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">My other achievements include owning and operating an entertainment company
                            called GS3Entertainment, providing social activities and parties for the Bay Area LGBTQ
                            Communities, raising a beautiful son, and being in a committed (and now legal) marriage for
                            over 30 years. I continued my tenure with our City working with another revenue generating
                            City department (San Francisco Department of Child Support Services) where I worked
                            throughout the country re-branding child-support system to include both parents with
                            employment and training opportunities. This approach revolutionized and strengthened the
                            entire family.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Currently, I work with the San Francisco Human Services Agency to continue
                            my commitment to help at-risk residents. I hope to work with the Pride board to create new
                            cost-saving partnerships with the City and establish new revenue-generating opportunities to
                            sustain San Francisco Pride for years to come. Building strong partnerships and solid
                            commitments to public service is my life. I believe my experience and knowledge will make me
                            a great addition to your Board of Directors.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">As an African American SF native with over a quarter century membership
                            with SF Pride, I am well positioned to execute meaningful change, whether that be
                            institutionalization of Black Lives Matter reforms, police reform, or corporate
                            accountability.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">During my tenure with SF Pride, I take great pride in partnering with
                            fellow African American Board member and civil rights pioneer Bill Beasley in inviting
                            Calvin Gipson to join SF Pride at the turn of the century. Calvin would become SF Pride’s
                            second African American Board President. Under his leadership, I had the pleasure of playing
                            a key role in executing a multi-year community wrap session exercise, designed to seek input
                            from our marginalized communities, resulting in the establishment of new stages and venues
                            that better reflected the diversity in our community.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">If you were to elect me, I would work with the board to reactivate our wrap
                            session model and get us back to framing our event around the needs of our community. In
                            addition, I would work with our stages and venues, which already represent African American,
                            Asian Pacific Islander, Latinx/Chicanx, and Women to ensure that SF Pride is meeting their
                            needs.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">My service to the community has not just been limited to SF Pride. Over the
                            decades, I co-founded SF LovEvolution (Love Parade) which, at its peak was one of the
                            nation’s largest outdoor celebrations of Electronic Dance Music (EDM). Speaking of EDM, 2020
                            marks my third decade of active involvement in San Francisco’s nightlife community.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Currently, I serve as a board member of Comfort & Joy, a SF-based queer
                            not-for-profit arts organization rooted in Burning Man culture. I also serve as volunteer
                            staff member at Burning Man.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">When I am not serving my community, my professional life brings to the
                            table over two decades of office/administrative leadership skills.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">With your vote, I would put to work my three decades of event/projects
                            management skills to execute change!</p>
