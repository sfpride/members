            <p>As we did in 2020, SF Pride will conduct the Board Election separately from the Annual General Meeting,
                and this year voting will be online. (This process is outlined in the by-laws under "written action by
                ballot without a meeting.") Voting online saves money and enables SF Pride to better support members who
                require accommodations to participate.</p>

            <h3>Open Seats</h3>
            <p>There are currently ten (10) seats on the Board of Directors up for election for the 2021-24 term. Nine
                candidates are running. A candidate will need to receive a majority vote (50%+1 of the votes cast) in
                order to win a seat on the Board.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <h3>Voter Eligibility</h3>
            <p>To vote, you must be a member in good standing of SF Pride and have registered no later than July 12,
                2021.</p>

            <h3>A Guide to the Voting Process</h3>
            <p>Eligible voting members may cast their ballots any time during the voting period, which will run from
                <b>Saturday, Sept. 11 to Tuesday, Sept. 14.</b> The voting period is open for 72 hours, from Noon
                Saturday to Noon Tuesday.</p>
            <p>Before the voting period opens, eligible voters will receive a voting code and voter key by email. This
                will contain all the information needed to participate in the 2021 San Francisco LGBT Pride Parade and
                Celebration Committee Board of Directors Election.</p>
            <p>Members shall cast their votes by indicating their choices on the electronic ballot. You may vote for as
                few or as many candidates as you like.</p>
            <p>Candidates receiving the highest simple majority votes (50% + 1) will fill the open seats in the order
                according to the numbers of votes they reached.</p>
            <p>The election will be valid only if the number of ballots cast is equal to or greater than a quorum
                (one-third of SF Pride’s total active membership as of the election date.) The number of ballots
                required will be noted on the ballot itself.</p>
            <p>A ballot on which a voter’s choice is unintelligible to the election officers and/or the election
                inspectors shall be disqualified.</p>
            <p>A voting member must: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Receive their voting code and voter key via email.</li>
                <li>Log into the electronic ballot link provided, using the code and key issued.</li>
                <li>Select their choices on the electronic ballot.</li>
                <li>Check and confirm their votes, then send the ballot in.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="em">Only the voting member should cast their vote, as the code and voter key will only allow ONE
                vote to be cast. Please do not share your login information, as it will invalidate your vote. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <h3>Candidate Statements</h3>
            <p>Candidates for the Board are encouraged, but not required, to submit a written statement in support of
                their candidacy. Statements and opinions expressed by the candidates do not necessarily reflect the
                views of SF Pride. Statements will be available at members.sfpride.org/election.</p>
            <h3>Lost Ballot Information, Need Voting Access</h3>
            <p>If you did not get a voter ID or voter key, or did not receive a link to the ballot, you may email us at
                membership@sfpride.org or call us at +1 (415) 864-0831 x 4 to request a new one. <span
                    class="text-danger">As stated above, only one voter code and key will be issued per eligible member,
                    and the staff team will verify each request for reissue.</span></p>
            <p>If you do not have regular internet access, <b>please make an appointment</b> to come into the SF Pride
                office during limited hours on Monday, Sept. 13 or Tuesday, Sept. 14. The voting period closes on
                Tuesday, Sept. 14 at approximately 12 PM Noon. Any members who vote at the office will need to properly
                wear a mask while indoors. Pride staff will provide sanitizer and a computer for voting. The member will
                need to log in to their email to access the election website and unique voting code. </p>
