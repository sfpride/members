            <p>As we did in 2020, SF Pride will conduct the Board Election online, separately from the Annual General Meeting. (This process is outlined in the by-laws under "written action by ballot without a meeting.") Voting online saves money and enables SF Pride to better support members who require accommodations to participate.</p>

                <li>Friday, Aug. 21 is 20 days prior to the AGM. As per the election procedures, a written notice will

                    notice will be sent via email.</li>
                <li>On Aug. 21, the notice is mailed, alongside written ballots. This mailing specifies:
                    <ul>

                <li>In-person voting or drop-off opportunities will be available twice per week during the voting period
                    (as a courtesy). These opportunities are TBD, and may include drop-in hours at the Pride offices or

                <li>The process by which votes are validated and counted.</li>
                <li>The vote validation and counting process will take place on Wednesday, Sept 23, which allows time
                    for any ballots postmarked on Sept 18 to arrive to the Pride offices.</li>
                <li>The vote validation and counting will take place in as safe a manner as possible, with masks and
